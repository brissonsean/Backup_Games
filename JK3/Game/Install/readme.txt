We recommend that you read this file to get the most up to date
information about installing, running, and playing the game.

Supported Operating Systems
-------------------
To be able to play Jedi Academy, you must have Windows 98, 98SE, Millennium Edition (ME), 2000, or XP installed and configured correctly, and your computer hardware must be OpenGL 1.4 and DirectX 9.0a compatible.

According to Microsoft, Windows 95 has entered its 
non-supported phase as of December 2001. Because of this, Jedi Academy doesn’t support this operating system. Windows 98 also entered its non-supported phase as of June 2003. Because of 
this, several hardware manufacturers are no longer developing drivers for this operating system.

If you are running Windows 2000 or XP, you must have local Administrator or Power User rights to properly install the 
game. Only local Administrator rights will allow you to 
update DirectX in these operating systems.

DirectX: Microsoft DirectX 9.0a is included on this CD. You
will be prompted to install DirectX during installation of
this game if a more recent version isn’t already properly
installed on your system.

NOTE: DirectX may require the "latest" updates for your
operating system. This may also include the latest drivers
for your particular motherboard, sound and video hardware.

Installation: Installation requires 1.3 GB of free hard
drive space. We recommend that you have at least an
additional 200 MB of free space available after installing
the game for the Windows swap/page file and save games.

Installing Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy
-------------------------------------------------
Insert the Jedi Academy CD into your CD-ROM drive. The launcher
screen will open automatically unless Autoplay is disabled. If
it does not, double-click on the My Computer icon, then the
CD-ROM icon. This should bring up the launcher menu. If it does
not, double-click on JediAcademy.exe in the window that opens.
Click on the top button from the following options and the
installer will guide you through the installation process.

You will be prompted to choose Automatic or Custom Installation.
Automatic installs Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy into
the default location on your hard drive, along with installing
DirectX if your computer requires it. Choosing Custom install
allows you to change the installation location, and will also
prompt you if you would like the required version of DirectX
to be installed. The default installation location is
C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy.

Running Jedi Academy
--------------------
To run the game, click on your Start Menu, select 
Programs, then LucasArts, then Star Wars Jedi Knight 
Jedi Academy and click on Launch Star Wars JK Jedi 
Academy.  Click on "Single Player Game" or "Multiplayer Game" on 
the Launcher and it will begin the game.

Desktop Color Palette
---------------------
We recommend that you set your desktop to High Color (16 bit)
color. When playing Jedi Academy with your desktop set to a
color palette other than 16 bit, you may experience various
problems while running the game.

Task Switching
--------------
Task switching is disabled when playing Jedi Academy in full
screen mode. In order to task switch, you must change Full
Screen to Off in the Video Setup screen.

CTRL-ESC
--------
We recommend that you do not use CTRL-ESC while playing.

“Console” commands
------------------
Jedi Academy’s console commands are primarily used for
development, testing, and product support purposes. Users
unfamiliar with these console commands should not attempt to
use them, as their use may result in game crashes, corrupted
graphics, and/or a variety of other issues. Console commands
and errors resulting from the use of console commands and/or
cheats are unsupported.

NUMPAD Keys
-----------
Due to the dual function of the NUMPAD (number pad) Keys, you
may experience problems when trying to enter numbers with the
NUMPAD (trying to type 4, for example, will also bring the
cursor over to the left). Because of this issue, we recommend
limited use of the NUMPAD in Jedi Academy.
