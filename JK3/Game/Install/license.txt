	This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed
entirely within California between California residents, and you hereby consent to
personal jurisdiction in California.  You and LucasArts each agree that any claim or
controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Software shall be settled
by expedited binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
Association.  Such arbitration shall take place in Marin County, California, and you waive
any claim that such forum is inconvenient.  Any such claim or controversy shall be
arbitrated solely on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any
other party.  The Arbitrator may not change the terms of this Agreement and may not
award any injunctive or other equitable relief.  If it is judicially determined that any claim
or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Software cannot be
settled by expedited binding arbitration as noted above, then you agree that any such
claims or controversies shall be brought and maintained in the state courts located within
the County of Marin, State of California or the federal courts of the Northern District of
California, and you waive any claim that either such forum is inconvenient.  The
foregoing shall not preclude LucasArts from seeking any injunctive relief for protection
of LucasArts' intellectual property rights.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to
be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions
shall be enforced.   LucasArts’ failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others
does not waive LucasArts’ right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and
LucasArts with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided herein, this
Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both parties; provided,
however, that LucasArts has the right, without notice and/or without a writing signed by
both parties, to amend this Agreement in connection with any modifications or updates
to the Software.
